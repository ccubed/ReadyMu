# ReadyMu
ReadyMu is a code suite by Gizmo AKA Oureadalf AKA Alzie that has everything you need to run a mush built in and ready to go. Utilities available with this code suite are as follows:

* Identities - Identities allows a player to have one player bit that controls several characters.
* Arc - The version of Arc found here has been modified to work with the Identities system.
* MuReq - This version of the MuReq system has been slightly modified to work with the identities system.


# Installation
Run Core.
Run Identities.
Afterwards you can run any or all of the systems at your leisure. It is not necessary to use any of them beyond Core and Identities.
